## Watchface Description
Introducing **WatchYourSugar** â€“ a visually pleasing watchface designed to prioritize aesthetics while seamlessly providing essential information about your blood sugar levels. Beyond displaying the standard time and date, WatchYourSugar prominently features your current blood sugar information sourced from the xDrip app on your phone.
